	"aboutdroidpapers" : "DroidPapers delivers official stock Android, Chrome and other open source and free wallpapers and ringtones. Download the wallpaper or ringtone you like and set it from within the app. App is and stays ad-free and there are no in-app purchases.",

	"answer1" : "When a wallpaper is failing to be set as your system wallpaper, the download went probably corrupt. This can happen on occasion, because of network slowdowns or failures. To retry select the option in the menu 'Delete from device' and then re-set the wallpaper again. The cache is deleted so it will trigger a re-download.",
	"answer2" : "This can happen when filenames are changed. Just un-favorite the broken wallpaper or ringtone or clear the entire application data.",
	"answer3" : "Content may not be processed into the local database correctly. Try a force download to re-write the content to the database. If that does not help try deleting your cache or reinstalling the app first.",
	"answer4" : "In order to provide this feature, the permissions 'WRITE_CONTACTS' and 'READ_CONTACTS' are needed. These permissions are needed for such a feature, but it gives the app implicit permission to access, read and write the entire address-book. For such a simple feature, it is just to much.<br /><br />There is a work-around though. When you want to set a ringtone as a contact ringtone, do the following. Open the ringtone in DroidPapers. Select 'Download only'. Open your contact in your address-book and select the ringtone from there.",
	"answer5" : "With the Dynamic Wallpaper service you can let DroidPapers automatically change your wallpaper. A random already downloaded wallpaper will be chosen on a specific time interval. You can choose the interval you desire. An interval of 1 minute roughly takes about 5% of your battery time. The greater the interval, the less usage.",
	"answer6" : "The Android operating system can stop and restart services when it needs more memory, storage or processing power. When the service restarts the wallpaper gets changed.",
	"answer7" : "All downloaded wallpapers in the folder: /sdcard/Pictures/DroidPapers. The service does NOT download wallpapers. This to prevent data-usage on mobile networks.",
